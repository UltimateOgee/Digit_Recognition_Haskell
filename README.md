Milestone 1 feedback 
Looks good!
* buildCorpus, you have a Shlemiel the Painter problem. You are computing 5000 entries, each of
  which requires going over all 5000 images, and only then removing duplicates.

  Core Project: 69/71
  * buildCorpus runs very slowly.
  Smoothing: 6/6
  Avoiding unnecessary work: 10/14
  * buildCorpus works but slows down the program, when rewriting corpus to work with a summary it
    still needs to run quickly.
  Decomposition and style: 3/3
